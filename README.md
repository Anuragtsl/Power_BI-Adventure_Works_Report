# What is Power BI??

Microsoft Power BI is a business intelligence platform that provides nontechnical business users with tools for aggregating, analyzing, visualizing and sharing data.

Power BI's user interface is fairly intuitive for users familiar with Excel 

and its deep integration with other Microsoft products makes it a very versatile self-service tool that requires little upfront training.
